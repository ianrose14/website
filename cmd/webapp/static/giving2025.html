        <h1>Giving 2025</h1>

        <p>
            As 2026 dawns, I thought I'd try something new to close out 2025. I've tried to be a bit more
            intentional about charitable giving this year, helped in part by more extensive use of DAFs (donor-advised
            funds) -- I've found that (i) DAFs made it easy to manage multiple monthly donations all from one place,
            and (ii) the psychology of "this money is already dedicated to charity" made it easier to give
            freely.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm frequently curious about how other people think about charitable giving. Do you choose to give more now,
            or keep funds invested with a plan to give more later? How do you balance local vs global causes?
            What do you think about "<a
                href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism">Effective
                Altruism</a>"?
            (It's gotten some bad press recently - e.g. thanks to conman <a
                href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231009-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-believed-in-effective-altruism-what-is-it">Sam
                Bankman-Fried</a> -
            but I think it's still an interesting idea worth debating.)
        </p>
        <p>
            In Peter Singer's book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49005196-the-life-you-can-save">The
                Life You Can Save</a>, he advocates for a <i>culture of giving</i>, including via social media.
            Publicly
            discussing charitable giving is difficult for most of us (it smacks of attention-seeking, and a bit
            self-congratulatory), but if you overcome this reticence, you are (theoretically) helping to normalize
            discussion around
            giving, and hopefully encouraging others to give more as well. As such, here's my attempt...

            What follows is a list of most of the organizations that I donated to in 2025. I decided not to
            include actual dollar amounts, as that was a step too far for me. And in particular, I think most would
            agree that your "responsibility" grows with your means, so that's going to be different for everyone.
            Peter Singer provides his own take on this via an <a
                href="https://boldreasoningwithpetersinger.substack.com/p/how-much-should-you-give">income-based
                rubric</a> for giving amounts. I did not intentionally follow this advice at all during the year,
            but now that I've added things up, I'm glad to see that I comfortably met his criterion.
        </p>
        <p>Let me know what you think. Did I miss some important charities? Are there substitutions I should consider?
            Do you have a fundamentally different approach or philosophy of giving?
            I'd love to hear your thoughts. If you are reading this page, you probably already have my e-mail or phone
            number...
